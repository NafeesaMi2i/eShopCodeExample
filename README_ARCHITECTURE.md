# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the eShopCodeExample repository. It outlines the roles of the ApplicationCore, BlazorAdmin, BlazorShared, and Web projects, their interactions, dependencies, and deployment characteristics.

## ApplicationCore
The ApplicationCore project serves as the heart of the system, containing the domain model and business logic. It defines entities such as `Basket`, `Buyer`, and `Order`, and aggregates that encapsulate the business rules. This project is referenced by other projects to enforce business invariants and execute domain behaviors.

## BlazorAdmin
BlazorAdmin is the administrative interface of the system. It provides pages for managing catalog items and other administrative tasks. BlazorAdmin relies on ApplicationCore for executing business logic and BlazorShared for accessing shared models like `CatalogItem` and `CatalogBrand`. It communicates with the Web project through HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations.

## BlazorShared
BlazorShared contains models and requests shared across multiple projects. It includes definitions for `CatalogItem`, `CatalogBrand`, and various response and request models used in API communication. Both BlazorAdmin and Web projects depend on BlazorShared to ensure consistency in data structures used across the system.

## Web
The Web project is the public-facing web application. It utilizes ApplicationCore for business logic and BlazorShared for shared models. The Web project serves as the entry point for users to interact with the system, providing features such as product browsing and order placement.

## Deployment and Communication
The projects are tightly coupled, with BlazorAdmin and Web depending on ApplicationCore for business logic and BlazorShared for shared models. While BlazorShared could be deployed independently, the other projects must be deployed together due to their dependencies. Communication between projects is achieved through direct method calls and shared libraries, with some HTTP requests for administrative tasks.

## Conclusion
Based on the dependencies and communication mechanisms, the codebase exhibits characteristics of a monolithic architecture. Projects are not designed to be deployed independently and rely on direct method calls and shared libraries for communication, indicating a single, unified codebase.
